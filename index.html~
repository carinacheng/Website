<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I am a second year astrophysics doctoral student at UC Berkeley. Originally
  from San Diego, I earned my undergraduate degree from UCLA. I am currently
  working with
  Professor <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/parsons.html">Aaron Parsons</a> on the detection of the Epoch of
  Reionization, a period of history in the early Universe when the first stars
  and galaxies ionized most of the neutral hydrogen. To look far back in time
  (about 13 billion years ago!)
  and carry out this experiment, we build radio telescopes
  in South Africa (<a href="http://eor.berkeley.edu">PAPER</a> and soon <a href="http://reionization.org">HERA</a>). </p>
<p>In addition to 21cm cosmology, I have
  research interests in optical astronomy, adaptive optics, black holes, and
  large-scale structure. In my free time you can find me traveling, watching
  movies, or doing outreach.

<H3>About Me</H3>
<p>I am a second-year astronomy graduate student at the University of 
California, Berkeley. I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at 
Cornell University, where I worked with the SOFIA team on data collected by 
the Cornell-built infrared instrument, FORCAST. My initial research involved 
calibration of the instrument following the first series of diagnostic flights 
aboard SOFIA. Later, I focused on the Ultra-Compact HII region W3(OH), a site 
of recent massive star formation. I utilized the radiative transfer code 
DUSTY to model the region, and the online Robitaille protostellar model grid 
to learn about nearby protostars.</p>

<p>Since arriving at Berkeley, I have worked with Professor 
<a href="astro.berkeley.edu/~gmarcy">Geoff Marcy</a>. My first project involved
the characterization of exoplanet host stars using the SpecMatch routine, 
which compares target star spectra to a stellar spectral library to determine
properties such as surfact temperature, gravity, and metallicity.
I conducted a rigorous analysis of the library, removing binary stars which
confuse the algorithm, in an effort to streamline the process by which host
star, and thus planet, parameters are determined.</p>

<p>I have since moved on to study binary stars themselves using both radial
velocity data from the California Planet Search and adaptive optics 
observations from the Lick Observatory's Shane 3-meter telescope. My ultimate
goal in this project is to contribute to the understanding of how planets form
and evolve in binary stellar systems, in comparison to single stellar systems.
I will pursue this question by surveying stars within 20 pc of the Sun using 
adaptive optics and RV data to isolate stars with binary companions. I will 
then use RV data to constrain the comparative occurrence rate and properties 
of planets in stellar systems with and without a binary companion.
