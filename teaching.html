        <h1> Philosophy </h1>

        <p> As an astronomy instructor, I strive to both inspire student curiosities about the Universe 
and also use the subject as a catalyst for engaging critical thinking, applying the scientific method, 
and developing problem solving skills. I am a big supporter of active learning, and I aim to foster a 
classroom environment where students feel comfortable thinking out loud and collaborating with their peers. 
I believe that developing detailed lesson plans with clear learning objectives is crucial, as well as being 
open to new teaching ideas and to student feedback. In alignment to my philosophy, I try to implement the 
following techniques consistently into my teaching: </p>
        <ul>
        <li> <b>Group Work</b>: It has been shown that peer instruction is an important part of student learning. In my discussion sections, I often employ small group discussions, partnered-teaching, and class presentations. Group work is a useful way to engage students for many reasons: students learn to collaborate, I can have meaningful interactions with subsets of students, and students are able to teach each other. </li><br>
        <li> <b>Short, Interactive Lectures</b>: Often sandwiching group work activities are short lectures in which I clarify key concepts and bring the class together as a whole. I use this time to answer questions, summarize topics, and motivate their work (relating it to the big picture). </li><br>
        <li> <b>Multiple Modalities</b>: One major challenge of teaching is in reaching all levels and types of students. On a practical level, I tackle this challenge by using a large variety of activities in the classroom. Some examples include: open-ended questions, applications to real research, concept maps, use of real data, connections to related topics, live hands-on demos, worksheets, board work, etc. Something I continually try to work on is developing creative lesson plans that probe a range of learning levels - a task that I find quite fun (but is hard work!). </li><br>
        <li> <b>Assessment and Feedback</b>: Collecting feedback from students has been instrumental for me in adapting my teaching techniques and growing as an effective instructor. In the classroom, I administer feedback cards regularly, as well as mid-semester and final evaluations. I care deeply about student progress and am interested in the development of both formative and summative assessment strategies and translating them into practical improvements. </li>
        </ul>
        

        <h1> Experience </h1>

        <h2> Pedagogy for First-Time GSIs </h2>
        <p>
        I am an instructor for the Astronomy Department's pedagogy course. This course is a requirement for all first-time GSIs and emphasizes the discussion and practice of teaching techniques, as applied to physics and astronomy. The class aims to pass on practical, pedagogical resources that are useful for graduate student instructors (GSIs) in both the short term (i.e. leading discussion sections) and long term (i.e. careers as professional teachers). The most recent <a href="http://badgrads.berkeley.edu/doku.php?id=astro300_f17", class="links">syllabus</a> for this class contains additional information about topics covered, useful teaching tips, and relevant links and resources.
        </p>

        <h2> Introduction to General Astronomy </h2>
        <p>
        I have been a GSI for the large, non-majors introduction to astronomy course for three semesters (F13,S14,S15), including being head-GSI (S15). I have a lot of fun teaching this class, especially in developing creative lesson plans, interacting with a diverse room of students, and sharing my love for astronomy with undergraduates who may have never been exposed to the subject before. 
        </p>
        <p>
        As head-GSI for instructor Alex Filippenko, I was responsible for 13 GSIs and 800+ students, a role that exposed me to the great fun, hard work, and nuances of running a large class. I even got to deliver a couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXr-DTe5D2E&list=PL-XXv-cvA_iAn6Qt6B7D-phRT0Ld1GOUV&index=25", class="links">lectures</a>!
