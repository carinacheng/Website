            <p> One thing I really love is traveling! Born in Germany and having lived in France, I've been lucky to experience multiple cultures. I've also been fortunate to be able to visit lots of different places, both through work and personal vacations. Hover over the pins to learn about some of my favorite places I've been to!</p>

        Berkeley

            <p>I currently live in Berkeley as a PhD student. I've been enjoying exploring the Bay, whether it be hiking, skiing, or eating!</p>

        SanDiego
            <span>
            <p>Growing up in Carmel Valley, I was spoiled with year-round sunshine and the beach practically next door. I attended Torrey Pines High School, spending my free time playing softball, piano, and making home-videos. I'm definitely a So-Cal girl at heart!</p>

        Cancun
            <span>
            <p>In 2014, my family took an adventurous trip to Cancun where we snorkeled with sea turtles, explored caves, swam in fresh water cenotes, visited ruins, drove ATV's, and jet-skiied!</p>

        CostaRica
            <span>
            <p> The highlight of my family's 2015 summer trip to Costa Rica was white-water rafting on the Pacuare River to an open-air lodge in the middle of the jungle where we zip-lined, hiked, rapelled down waterfalls, and slept to the sounds of the monkeys and rushing river.</p>

        SouthAfrica
            <span>
            <p>A work trip brought me to the middle of the Karoo Desert in South Africa to help build HERA dishes. It was a neat experience living in a radio-quiet, deserted location for a couple weeks, where I learned a ton about the instruments whose data I analyze and had fun experimenting with night photography of the dark, star-filled sky.</p>

        Cambodia/Thailand
            <span>
            <p> In 2014 I traveled to Cambodia and Thailand. Angkor Wat was incredible, but a highlight of the visit was learning about the heroic Aki Ra at the Landmine Museum. I also enjoyed petting tigers and exploring islands in Thailand.</p>

        China
            <span>
            <p>I traveled to China for the first time with my family in 2010. We explored the Great Wall in Beijing, awed at the Terra Cotta soldiers in Xi'an, relaxed on bamboo rafts in Yangshuo, and got lost on an unintentional 18-mile hike down and up stairs on the side of Mount Huangshan.</p>

            <span>
            <p>Before a conference at Cambridge University, I took a road trip to Bath, Winderemere, Edinburgh, and London. It was my first time in the UK and I especially enjoyed Scotland and the quaint towns in the Lake District.</p>

        France
            <span>
            <p>I spent the year 2004-2005 living in Southern France with my family (near Nice and Cannes). I attended an international school where I took 13 different classes and made friends from all over the world. One of the best parts of the year living abroad was getting to travel all over Europe, including Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. We skiied in Innsbruck, visited the ruins of Pompeii, explored salt mine caves in Switzerland, and drove to Italy for dinner on weekends because we lived so close!</p>

        Germany
            <span>
            <p>My parents lived in Munich, Germany for 5 years. After being born, I spent the first 2.5 years of my life there. Unfortunately, I have no memories from this but am told I was speaking toddler-German with kids on the playground! It was great to go back to visit our old house and friends in Germany during the year we lived in France.</p>
